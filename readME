-npm init ==> to create package.json::
-create folders ::
	routes
	controllers
	config
	models
	views
	
-npm install express::
-fire up the express server::
	const express = require('express');
	const app = express();
	const port = 8000;// When we deploy the app on production its port should be 80

	app.listen(port, function(err){
	    if(err){
		console.log(`There is an error in running the server`);
		return;
	    }
	    console.log(`Server is running fine on port ${port}`);

	});
-Now, get rid of firing the server. So go to package.json 
	=> under script => add "start" key and make its value as "nodemon index.js"
	=> So now onwards just write "npm start" on terminal to fire up the server.
	
-Now intialise git 
	=>git init
-add gitignore file to ignore node_modules folder as this folder makes lot of weightage in space. Then stage and commit everything.
