SASS(Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is indented syntax and SCSS(Sassy Cascading Style Sheets)is having brackets
About SASS:
	Sass stands for Syntactically Awesome Stylesheet
	Sass is an extension to CSS
	Sass is a CSS pre-processor
	Sass is completely compatible with all versions of CSS
	Sass reduces repetition of CSS and therefore saves time
	Sass was designed by Hampton Catlin and developed by Natalie Weizenbaum in 2006
	Sass is free to download and use.
Use of SASS:
	Stylesheets are getting larger, more complex, and harder to maintain. This is where a CSS pre-processor can help.
	Sass lets you use features that do not exist in CSS, like variables, nested rules, mixins, imports, inheritance, built-in  		functions, and other stuff.
	
e.g
CSS =>
	div p a {
		CSS properties
	}
SASS =>
	div
	    properties of div
	    p
		properties of p tag
		a
		   properties of a tag
		   
SCSS = >
	div{
		properties of div.
		p{
			properties of p tag.
			a{
				properties of a tag.
			}
		}
	}
